Programming language is important because it defines the relationship, semantics and grammar which allows the programmers to effectively communicate with the machines that they program.

<h2>A programming languages serve several purposes:</h2>

You can instruct the computer what to do in a human-readable form
Allows the programmer to structure the instructions into functions, procedures, etc.
This also allows the program to be broken into "chunks" which can be developed by a group of developers
Provides portability - the low-level instructions of one computer will be different from that of another computer.
Computer programmers have a full understanding of the how and why of computer systems, including system limitations, and can set realistic expectations and work around those limitations to fully maximize the use of the equipment and its accessories.
Programming, especially in web development, has allowed new interactive web applications that have access to system resources and provide the same level of control as desktop applications. Used on online learning platforms, these applications have allowed distance-learning programs to take off. Today, almost all major learning institutions have some form of online learning implementation, thanks to computer programming.
Computer programming principles implemented today will likely influence how technologies such as voice-recognition, artificial intelligence and other sophisticated technologies will change in the future and how they will be applied to our day-to-day lives. For example, the trend toward automating Internet searches and purchases to be more localized is ongoing. While the hardware platforms developed will play a major role, computer technology will likely be at the center of it all and programming future systems will be an important aspect.
We can use it to give a set of commands to modern devices, to come out to us as a set of programs.
Were it not for the programming languages, today we would not be able to use the Internet well, whether on a computer or a smartphone.
We can avoid a lot of profits from working in programming and getting to know more than one programming language.
Programmers use a number of automatic codes that increase their productivity, thus saving time and effort and increasing profit

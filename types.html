<h3>C</h3>
 is one of the oldest and most versatile of computer languages. While it was originally created for Unix systems, it’s used across platforms. It’s often used in gaming. Despite the fact that C has been around since the mid-20th century and is the precursor to most other languages, C remains one of the most common programming languages. 

<h3>C++</h3> 

C++ is an object-oriented, intermediate-level coding language. While it has its roots in C, it is far better suited to large, complicated projects and high-performance applications. Many large corporations use C++. 

<h3>C#</h3> 

C#, or C Sharp, is an easy-to-learn object-oriented language, and a member of the C family. Designed by Microsoft, C# is used for mobile and desktop applications, games, websites, and database applications. 

<h3>Java</h3> 

Java is one of the most versatile and compatible programming languages, and one of the most commonly used. Java powers the operating system behind Android phones, which dominate 88 percent of the cell phone market. Java can be used to program applications, and for small and large system development.  

<h3>JavaScript</h3> 

JavaScript is often confused with Java. They’re both trademarked by Oracle, but they are very different. JavaScript is one of the most powerful, dynamic and flexible object-oriented languages out there, and is perhaps the most important to learn. It is the most popular programming language by far, and is still increasing in popularity. JavaScript is the go-to language for websites that offer animation, graphics, slideshows, and interactive forms. JavaScript is the reason web users are able to input information and interact with most websites they visit each day. 

<h3>PHP</h3> 

PHP was created in 1994 specifically for web development under the name of Personal Home Page. The acronym hasn’t changed, but today it stands for Hypertext Preprocessor. PHP is still used for web development. PHP is easily embeddable into HTML codes and vice versa. 

<h3>Python</h3> 

Python is another programming language that is commonly used. It’s a high-level, general-purpose language used by internet powerhouses such as Google, Dropbox, Venmo, YouTube, and Yahoo Maps
